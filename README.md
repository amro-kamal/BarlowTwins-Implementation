Pytorch/XLA mplementation for "Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction" (not completed!)

current results

Model        |  dataset    | linear_classifier test acc | knn classifier acc  |
------------ | ------------|    ------------------      |     ------------    |
resnet18     | Cifar10     |         75.2%              |                     |
 
The table contains the first result I got (without any hyperparameters tuning), so the results can be improved. The resullts for resnet50 was not good (for the first try also), more experiments on resnet50 will be done
